## Description

This program allows users to automate the process of creating professional README files. The motivation for this was to drastically improve the quality of my README files for my public repositories because, as a new developer, I was not familiar with best practices - now I donâ€™t even need to think about it! Being my first node.js application using the command line, I was pleasantly surprised how I was able to apply my javascript knowledge to make this application function how I wanted.

## Installation

This requires node.js to be installed in order to run the application.

## Usage

## Tests

First, I used console logs to ensure I was properly accepting all user input. I then tested the formatting of markdown files to ensure the output would have the desired appearance.
